# About
Hello! My name is Zac Gwennap, a Mechanical Engineer interested in additive manufacturing, design, and robotics.

## Who I Am
I recently graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 2024 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. My past experience includes being an intern at [NASA Headquarters](https://www.nasa.gov/stem-content/x-59-3d-printing/) and working as an undergraduate researcher at the [Additive Manufacturing and Metamaterials (AMML) Lab](https://www.raynexzheng.com/) for over two years.

Outside of work, you will find me rock climbing and designing 3D printers!
