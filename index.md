## Who I Am
I recently graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 2024 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. My past experience includes being an <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/stem-content/x-59-3d-printing/" target="_blank">intern at NASA Headquarters</a> and working as an undergraduate researcher at the <a href="https://www.raynexzheng.com/" target="_blank">Additive Manufacturing and Metamaterials (AMML) Lab</a> for over two years.

Outside of work, you will find me rock climbing and designing 3D printers!
